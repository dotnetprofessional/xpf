xpf - Cross Platform Framework

The goal of xpf is to provide a series of small components that can be used in most if not all C# environments. The components are spilt into their respective area's of concern. This is to allow consumers to pick an choose which parts are useful for a given project. Dependencies betweeen components are kept to a minimum to reduce the impact of picking on component brining in all the components.

The current state is alpha, though a lot of the code has been developed over the past few years.

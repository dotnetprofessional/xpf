FileSystem - Specification
--------------------------
- Support multiple files systems such as Physical(disk), OneDrive, DropBox, RamDrive etc
- Fluent API
- Cross Platform
- Mockable
- Possibly use a driver model, which doesnt have fluent API but has the core commands for the file system which the API delegates to.
- Possibly have file systems be automatically discovered? Possibly too slow as the object will be used and disposed of regularly.
